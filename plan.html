<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<h1>Diggers Beach Volleyball</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Arjun Angu Velu Rajamanickam<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc305967</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<div>Diggers beach volleyball web site aims to increase revenue for the company by encouraging more people to play at Diggers. <br>
It is intended to attract people and inform them about Beach volleyball is a great family sport so that young people would enjoy the&nbsp;recreational&nbsp;services offered. <br>
It is not an online shop (customers can not buy online).</div>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The main success measurement will be an increase in players at Diggers each week. Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for the new web site), so that any increase in players should be attributable to the site.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Locals, mostly males between the ages of 35 and 50 form the majority of current customers, and now we aim at younger audience, getting high school kids adn young adults playing.<br>
More people would come, play and watch competitions if they knew about Diggers beach volleyball more.</p>
