<h1>About VolleyBall</h1>
Volleyball is a sport where two teams play on a playing court divided by a net.

The objective of this game is to to send the ball regularly over the net to ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded on its own court. <br><br>

The ball is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the opponent's court and each time, a team is allowed to hit the ball three times to return it to the opponent's court. <br><br>

A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block and The rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes "out" or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault. <br><br>
Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage. <br>
